# Money Update - time is money
-----

The update adds a coin item to the game that is minted on the anvil of precious (valuable) metals like gold.

Why is time money? Well, because the obtained ore is the time spent working. Who works a lot, is rich? The regulation and value of a currency will be determined by the amount of time it takes to extract resources and turn them into coins. Since the dawn of time, the gold system has worked this way, and wealth has been defined by it.

Coins will become the default currency of the NPC.
