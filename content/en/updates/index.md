The structure and changes to be introduced within the project are divided into **updates** - i.e. concepts or ideas with precisely defined scopes. Each update has its own **page**, where it is described with an indication of what changes, improvements or novelties will bring to the game.

As a rule, each of the updates is thought out and designed in a way that ensures its greatest **autonomy**. This makes it possible to use the update potential itself, without having to wait for interoperable updates.

For a better understanding of **connections and synergies** between updates, there is a dependency list with a short summary at the end of each update description page.
