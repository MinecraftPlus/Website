Basic BukkitAPI is currently not enough, most of the plugins currently in use require installation on SpigotAPI based servers.

The changes from the [Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/) project, which is an extension of the CraftBukkit project, will be implemented into the server engine. The result will be the server engine - SpigotPlus, based on the Spigot API.
