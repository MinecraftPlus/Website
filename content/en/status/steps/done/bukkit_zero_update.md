An important step will be to integrate the changes from the CraftBukkit project with the basic version of MC+. This will allow you to get a working release, without any changes to the original version of the game, with the ability to run plugins based on [Bukkit API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/bukkit).
