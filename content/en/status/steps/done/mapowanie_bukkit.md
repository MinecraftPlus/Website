Minecraft supplied by the manufacturer (.jar archives) by default are [darkened](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaciemowanie_kodu) and decompiled code requires conversion to friendly nomenclature using mapping files. Since version 1.14.4 Mojang has its own name mapping and this is used in the MC+ project code.

The problem is that the Bukkit team adopted their own nomenclature when starting work on the project (and it is maintained in [Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/spigot) and [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)) classes and all the rest. To conveniently combine the changes made to the [CraftBukkit](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/craftbukkit) project, the patches provided in it must be transferred to the appropriate nomenclature.
