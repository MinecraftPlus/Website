Developing a large-scale project like MC+ takes an enormous amount of time. The current form of the project does not allow it to be made available to the public for wider collaboration. For this reason, no one can use the solutions offered or support the development of the project.

After the full transformation of the project, each of its components will be provided with appropriate manuals, guidelines on how to develop the project and will be available in the MinecraftPlus repository on GitHub.com.
